  abstract  = "KRAS mutations are one of the most frequent oncogenic mutations
               of all human cancers, being more prevalent in pancreatic,
               colorectal, and lung cancers. Intensive efforts have been
               encouraged in order to understand the effect of KRAS mutations,
               not only on tumor cells but also on the dynamic network composed
               by the tumor microenvironment (TME). The relevance of the TME in
               cancer biology has been increasing due to its impact on the
               modulation of cancer cell activities, which can dictate the
               success of tumor progression. Here, we aimed to clarify the pro-
               and anti-inflammatory role of KRAS mutations over the TME,
               detailing the context and the signaling pathways involved. In
               this review, we expect to open new avenues for investigating the
               potential of KRAS mutations on inflammatory TME modulation,
               opening a different vision of therapeutic combined approaches to
               overcome KRAS-associated therapy inefficacy and resistance in
               cancer.",

  abstract  = "Tumors driven by mutant KRAS are among the most aggressive and
               refractory to treatment. Unfortunately, despite the efforts,
               targeting alterations of this GTPase, either directly or by
               acting on the downstream signaling cascades, has been, so far,
               largely unsuccessful. However, recently, novel therapeutic
               opportunities are emerging based on the effect that this
               oncogenic lesion exerts in rewiring the cancer cell metabolism.
               Cancer cells that become dependent on KRAS-driven metabolic
               adaptations are sensitive to the inhibition of these metabolic
               routes, revealing novel therapeutic windows of intervention. In
               general, mutant KRAS fosters tumor growth by shifting cancer
               cell metabolism toward anabolic pathways. Depending on the
               tumor, KRAS-driven metabolic rewiring occurs by up-regulating
               rate-limiting enzymes involved in amino acid, fatty acid, or
               nucleotide biosynthesis, and by stimulating scavenging pathways
               such as macropinocytosis and autophagy, which, in turn, provide
               building blocks to the anabolic routes, also maintaining the
               energy levels and the cell redox potential (1). This review will
               discuss the most recent findings on mutant KRAS metabolic
               reliance in tumor models of pancreatic and non-small-cell lung
               cancer, also highlighting the role that these metabolic
               adaptations play in resistance to target therapy. The effects of
               constitutive KRAS activation in glycolysis elevation, amino
               acids metabolism reprogramming, fatty acid turnover, and
               nucleotide biosynthesis will be discussed also in the context of
               different genetic landscapes.",

  abstract  = "The KRAS gene (Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
               homolog) is an oncogene that encodes a small GTPase transductor
               protein called KRAS. KRAS is involved in the regulation of cell
               division as a result of its ability to relay external signals to
               the cell nucleus. Activating mutations in the KRAS gene impair
               the ability of the KRAS protein to switch between active and
               inactive states, leading to cell transformation and increased
               resistance to chemotherapy and biological therapies targeting
               epidermal growth factor receptors. This review highlights some
               of the features of the KRAS gene and the KRAS protein and
               summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism of KRAS gene
               regulation. It also underlines the importance of activating
               mutations in the KRAS gene in relation to carcinogenesis and
               their importance as diagnostic biomarkers, providing clues

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Activating mutations in KRAS frequently occur in
               colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, leading to resistance to
               EGFR-targeted therapies. METHODS: To better understand the
               cellular reprogramming which occurs in mutant KRAS cells, we
               have undertaken a systems-level analysis of four CRC cell lines
               which express either wild type (wt) KRAS or the oncogenic
               KRASG13D allele (mtKRAS). RESULTS: RNAseq revealed that genes
               involved in ribosome biogenesis, mRNA translation and metabolism
               were significantly upregulated in mtKRAS cells. Consistent with
               the transcriptional data, protein synthesis and cell
               proliferation were significantly higher in the mtKRAS cells.
               Targeted metabolomics analysis also confirmed the metabolic
               reprogramming in mtKRAS cells. Interestingly, mtKRAS cells were
               highly transcriptionally responsive to EGFR activation by
               TGF$\alpha$ stimulation, which was associated with an unexpected
               downregulation of genes involved in a range of anabolic
               processes. While TGF$\alpha$ treatment strongly activated
               protein synthesis in wtKRAS cells, protein synthesis was not
               activated above basal levels in the TGF$\alpha$-treated mtKRAS
               cells. This was likely due to the defective activation of the
               mTORC1 and other pathways by TGF$\alpha$ in mtKRAS cells, which
               was associated with impaired activation of PKB signalling and a
               transient induction of AMPK signalling. CONCLUSIONS: We have
               found that mtKRAS cells are substantially rewired at the
               transcriptional, translational and metabolic levels and that
               this rewiring may reveal new vulnerabilities in oncogenic KRAS
               CRC cells that could be exploited in future.",
